# Advanced-Arduino-Weather-Station-Using-DHT11-and-Serial-Data-Logging
An Arduino Uno (CH340G clone) reads temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor and computes 10+ environmental metrics (heat index, dew point, enthalpy, humidex, vapor pressures, etc.), outputting them as CSV-formatted serial data for real-time monitoring, logging, or visualization on a connected Python-based host device.
